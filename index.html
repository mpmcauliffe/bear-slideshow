            <p> I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my
            own existence, just as you endangered yours. You bet. Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys,
            how are you doing? Next, please. Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the
            tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they
            say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I
            can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man.</p>

            <p>C'mon. Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing. I don't know, but I'm gonna
            find out. Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance. It's
            taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision
            of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around
            here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old
            man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine
            trees. </p>
